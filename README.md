# Daily UI Projects

This repository contains the code to my attempts at [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/) tasks.

I\'m attempting to create all the design prompts in HTML5 and CSS. By doing so, I\'ll create working, tangible prototypes for each task. My main emphasis is to learn the effective use of CSS animations.
